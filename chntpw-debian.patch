+.SH NAME
+chntpw \- utility to overwrite Windows NT/2000 SAM passwords
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B chntpw
+.RI [ options ]
+.RI < samfile > 
+.RI [ systemfile ]
+.RI [ securityfile ]
+.RI [ otherreghive ] 
+.RI [...]
+.br
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This manual page documents briefly the
+.B chntpw
+command.
+This manual page was written for the Debian distribution
+because the original program does not have a manual page.
+.PP
+.B chntpw
+is a utility to view some information and change user passwords 
+in a Windows NT/2000 SAM userdatabase file. It is not necessary to
+know the old passwords to reset them.  In addition it contains a 
+simple registry editor (same size data writes)
+and hex-editor with which the information contained in a registry
+file can be browsed and modified.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.TP
+.B \-h
+Show summary of options.
+.TP
+.B \-u username
+Username to change. Default is Administrator
+.TP
+.B \-l
+List all users in the SAM database.
+.TP
+.B \-i
+Interactive: list all users (as per -l) and then ask for the 
+user to change.
+.TP
+.B \-e
+Registry editor with limited capabilities.
+.TP
+.B \-d
+Use buffer debugger.
+.TP
+.B \-t
+Show hexdumps of structs/segments (deprecated debug function).
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.TP
+.B chntpw sam system
+Opens registry hives 
+.B sam 
+and 
+.B system
+and change administrator account. This will work even if the name
+has been changed or it has been localized (since different language
+versions of NT use different administrator names).
+.TP
+.B chntpw -u jabbathehutt mysam
+Prompts for password for 
+.B jabbathehutt
+and changes it in the 
+.B mysam
+registry file, if found (otherwise do nothing)
+.SH SEE ALSO
+If you are looking for an automated procedure for password 
+recovery, you might look at the bootdisks provided by the
+upstream author at
+.BR http://home.eunet.no/~pnordahl/ntpasswd/
+.br
+There is more information on how this program works available at
+.IR /usr/share/doc/chntpw
+. This information includes in-depth information on how the 
+registry works, what are syskeys and some other issues.
+.SH AUTHOR
+This manual page was written by 
+Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Peña <jfs@computer.org>,
+for the Debian GNU/Linux system (but may be used by others).
